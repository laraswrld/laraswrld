# Hi, I'm Ilaria 
<img width="100%" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x80/7B4EA3/FFFFFF?text=Ilaria+Bernardi" />

I'm a computer science student at Georgia Tech focusing on DevOps, automation, and the tools that make software easier to build and deploy. I like working on small, practical projects that help me understand how code moves from a local machine into a real environment.

### What I’m learning right now
- CI/CD fundamentals with GitHub Actions  
- Containerization with Docker and basic Kubernetes concepts  
- Linux essentials for troubleshooting and scripting  
- How storage, workflows, and pipelines interact on real systems  

### What I enjoy working on
- Building simple pipelines that catch problems early  
- Debugging failing jobs and tracing issues in logs  
- Writing clean, minimal scripts  
- Improving documentation so workflows are easier to follow  

### Projects
- **CI/CD Automation Practice** – experimenting with triggers, jobs, and secrets  
- **Docker Playground** – small containers to practice building and running images  
- **Kubernetes Notes** – learning deployments, pods, and services through small examples  
- **Roamio** – a student-life app where I worked on backend, data flows, and system design  
- **Workflow + Storage Experiments** – hands-on work with reproducibility and HPC tools  

### A little about me
I like systems that are reliable, documented, and easy to understand. Most of my projects are focused on getting better at the fundamentals—version control, automation, containers, and the steps that keep engineering teams moving.
