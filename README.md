# Hi, I'm Ilaria 

I'm a computer science student at Georgia Tech focusing on DevOps, automation, and the tools that make software easier to build and deploy. I like working on small, practical projects that help me understand how code moves from a local machine into a real environment.

### What I’m learning right now
- CI/CD fundamentals with GitHub Actions  
- Containerization with Docker and basic Kubernetes concepts  
- Linux essentials for troubleshooting and scripting  
- How storage, workflows, and pipelines interact on real systems
